##kNN Model
The current model utilises the 2 nearest neighbours to make the prediction
and uses the "distance" weights option. The parameters were selected through:
1) Plotting the accuracy of the model vs the number of neighbours
 (see "uniform accuracy.png" and "distance accuracy.png")
2) Using 5-Fold cross-validation to plot the MSE mean and variance for 
different number of neighbours (see all other pics lol)
